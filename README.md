# Digital Clock (12 Hours Format)

The Digital Clock project is built using React.js and displays the current time with real-time updates. It shows hours, minutes, and seconds formatted in 12-hour format with an AM/PM indicator, and also includes the current date in a user-friendly format. The project uses useState and useEffect hooks to keep the time updated every second, and is styled with custom CSS to create a clean, centered digital clock interface.
